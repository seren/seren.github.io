Hi, this is my blog and an excuse to play around with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

I'm currently an HCI masters student and devops engineer, living an interesting year in Paris.

I write about my interests, mainly technology and observations about life. Enjoy.
