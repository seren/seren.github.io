First Post
==========


It's amazing how many projects one can start (and occasionally finish) when there's something more important to be done. [Structured Procrastation](http://www.structuredprocrastination.com/) is a concept that a [good friend](https://twitter.com/thedward) told me about years ago, and it's a powerful force.

In the last 24 hours, I've cleaned up a backlog of email, setup a blog on Github (tada!), established a working VPN to deal with China's firewall, come up with a dozen project ideas, updated my [LinkedIn profile](http://www.linkedin.com/in/seren), researched good alternatives to Google ([StartPage](https://startpage.com) is ok but I'll keep using [DDG](https://duckduckgo.com)), and touched up a few ruby projects.

The coming weeks are going to get busy, so hopefully I'll be able to update this blog at intervals with tech tips and thoughts, as well as reflections on being an American in France, an expectant parent, and an older student. :) For now though, it's time to work... ;)
