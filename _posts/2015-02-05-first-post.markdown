First Post
==========

It's amazing how many projects one can start (and occasionally finish) when there's something more important to be done. [Structured Procrastation][http://www.structuredprocrastination.com/] is a concept that a good [friend][https://twitter.com/thedward] told me about years ago. In the last 24 hours, I've written a ton of email, setup a blog on Github (tada!), established a working VPN through the GFW of China, come up with a dozen project ideas, updated my [LinkedIn profile][http://www.linkedin.com/in/seren], researched good alternatives to Google ([StartPage][https://startpage.com] is ok but I'll keep using [DDG][https://duckduckgo.com]), and touched up a few ruby projects.

The coming weeks are going to get busy, so hopefully I'll be able to update this blog regularly with tech tips and thoughts, as well as reflections on being an American in France, expectant parent, and older student. For now, it's time to clean the house. :)
